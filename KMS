AWS Key Management Service (KMS):
---------------------------------
- Service useful to create and control encryption keys used to encrypt data.
- It is integrated with other services like EBS, S3, RDS, Redshift, Elastic Transcoder, WorkMail etc
- It is part of IAM.
- ***** IAM is global, but KMS (part of IAM) is region specific.
- Key Material Origin : KMS or External
- KMS Customer Master Key (CMK):
    . alias
    . creation date
    . description
    . key state
    . Key material (either customer provided or AWS provided)
    . Can never be exported *****

- For keys exporting use Cloud HSM.
- KMS uses multi-tenanted hardware whereas HSM is dedicated to user.

- CMK creation:
    . use encryption key in IAM
    . Define key administrative permissions (who can administrate this key)
    . Define key usage permissions (IAM users/roles that can use this key to encrypt & decrypt)
    . we can add external accounts to encrypt & decrypt using keys.

- Useful commands:
  . aws kms encrypt : encrypt data
  . aws kms decrypt : decrypt data
  . aws kms re-encrypt : encrypted already encrypted data
  . aws kms enable-key-rotation : key rotation of KMS

- Envelope Keys: Keys which are used to encrypt KMS keys are called envelope keys.
      . Envelope Encryption: Master key is used to encrypt data key (envelope key). envelope key is used to encypt data.
      . Decryption : Encrypted data key is decrypted using master key and algorithm. Decrypted envelope key is used to decrypt data.

- ** Disable keys and then delete them. We can delete them directly, we need to schedule a deletion between 7 - 35 days.
