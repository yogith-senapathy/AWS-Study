. Relational Database : simple , concept of tables : rows and cloumns
                        In relational databases, we cannot include few and exclude others. All rows and columns must be satisfied in the table.
                        Examples of relational databases:
                             - SQL
                             - Oracle
                             - MySQL
                             - Postgre SQL
                             - AWS Aurora - ( MySQL and Postgre SQL ) - massive performance and good redundancy
                             - MariaDB

. Non-Relational Database : It consists of:
                                           Collection (Table)
                                                - Document (Rows)
                                                     - Key Value Pairs (Fields)
                             
                            Amazon offers NoSQL database as Dynamo DB where data is stored in json format


. Data Warehousing : Used for Business Intelligence. Used to pull large amounts of data
                      SAP, Oracle hyperion, Cognos
                    AWS Offers "RedShift" as it's data warehouse

. OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) : It is a quey made to get details of a particular item (table,row/column)
. OLAP (Online Analytics Processing) : Used to pull large amounts of data from Data warehouses.

. Elastic Cache : AWS webservice which offers easy deploy, operate and scale in-memory cache
                  helps improve web performance by fast pulling of data from cache instead of from huge databases.
                  This is of two types:
                     - Memcached : Widely used
                     - Redis : key- value store
                               supports sets and lists
                               supports master/slave and also Multi AZ for redundancy

RDS :
----------

. Connection String: Username and password value given to connect to database

. AWS RDS end point is a domain url and not a IPv4 address. We use DNS name to connect from other servies such as ec2

. Hostname = RDS endpoint (DNS name)

. *** If an ec2 instance in one security group and RDS in another security group, they won't connect and results in error.
      To resolve : open 3306 port in RDS security group to security group in which ec2 instace is created.

. Backup's, Multi AZ's and Replicas:
  --------------------------
    . Backup's : There are two different types of Backup's
                 - Automated Backup: 
                             - allow recover database at any point of time within retention period.
                             - retention period is usually from 1 to 35 days
                             - will take a full daily snapshot & store transaction logs
                             - most recent backedup snapshot will be used during retention
                             - These are enabled by default
                             - Snapshots will be stored in S3 and size of S3 will be equal to size of RDS and no additional costs
                             - During backup Storage I/O may be suspended - results in a bit latency

                  - Data Base Snapshots:
                              - These are done manually
                              - ** They are stored even after deletion of original RDS. This is not available in automated backup.
                                         ( In automated backup, if RDS is deleted then backup snapshots also gets deleted)

        - ** When we restore RDS from either automated/manual back up, the restored one will be a new RDS and will have new domain DNS.

    . Encryption : 
                - Encryption is available at REST for Oracle, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and Aurora
                - Encryption done by using KMS (Key managed Service)
                - Once RDS is encrypted all data stored, backups, snapshots and repllicas will also be encrypted
                - At present we cannot encrypt already existing DB
                - To encrypt existing DB --> create snapshot of it --> copy snapshot and encrypt it


    . Multi AZ's : 
                - will create an exact copy of database in another Availability Zone
                - AWS handles replication of data in both RDS
                - If one RDS fails/ AZ fails AWS can transfer data to copy of RDS in another availability zone.
                - ****** Multi AZ's should be used onlly for disaster recovery and not for performance improvement.
                - ****** For performance improvemnets use "Read Replicas"
                - Multi AZ is available for oracle, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and Aurora
                - ** These are synchronous


    . Read Replica :
                - will create a Read-only copy of database
                - ** This is asynchronous copy of data from RDS/database to replica
                - This is used for high performance. Read only for heave database workloads
                - Is available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and Aurora
                - used for scaling and not for disaster recovery
                - ** To have Read Replica, we have to enable "Automated Backup"
                - we can have 5 copies of replica
                - Each replica has a dns end point ( because it is also a database )
                - We can create read replica for a replica
                - we can create Multi AZ for a replica
                - We can create read replica of multi az databases
                - Replicas can be promoted to serve as main databases. Then it will never be a replica.
                - We can enable encryption in read replicas even if main RDA is not encrypted


Dynamo DB:
----------
. It is a NoSQL database which supports both json format (key, value) and document type data

. useful for mobile, gaming, IOT

. DynamoDB stored on SSD

. Spread across 3 regions

. Consistency :
     - Eventual Consistency : Gets updated data with in a second . Best for reading

     - Strongly consistency : Immediate update of data across globe

. Pricing :
     - Write data : $0.0065 for every 10 units
     - Read data : $0.0065 for every 50 Units . 
     - Read data is cheaper than write data in dynamodb.

. Reserved Capacity : We can buy capacity from AWS for dynamo db ( just like reserved ec2 instances)

. Metrics : Read Capacity, Write capacity, Thrpttled read and write requests

. Capacity increase : we can increase Read and Write count capacity by UI and there willbe no downtime during this process. Whereas in RDS we will have downtime during capacity increase.

. ** DynamoDB Accelarator (DAX): Cache service for DynamoDB to provide frequently accessed data at much faster speeds.


Redshift:
---------
. It is the datawarehouse service provided by AWS.

. Fast, powerful, supports petabytes of data and cheaper than many datawarehousing services provided in market

. Uses OLAP (Online Analytics processing)

. Datawarehousing is all about adding & reading multiple cloumns of an entity

. Redshift Configuration:
      - Single Node (160 GB) : initial setup where only one node acts as Redshift database.

      - MultiNode:
             - Leader Node: Manages client connections and receives queries. Will flush data to multiple Compute Nodes.
             - Compute Node: stores data and performs queries. We can have upto 128 compute nodes.

. Columnar Data Storage:
           - Redshift stores data as columns instead of rows
           - column based are suitable for data warehouseing, analytics ; where queries are made on large data sets
           - row based is suitable for transaction processing
           - column data is sequentially stored in Redshift. This results in less I/O & high performance during data reading

. Advanced Compression:
           - Column data can be compressed easily than row type data
           - Less space and better compression techniques for column data
           - Amazon Reshift will automatically detect best compressor for our data

. Massive Parallel Processing (MPP):
          - Amazon Redshift will distribute queries & loads across all available nodes - so better performance
          - we can easily add nodes to redshift

. Pricing:
    - Compute Node pricing : - we will be charged for compute nodes and not for leader nodes. Charge is based on billing hours

    - Backup
  
    - Data Transfer - only within a vpc

. Encryption:
      - At transit : SSL encryption
      - At rest : AES-256 encryption. Keys can be KMS or HSM

. Availabilty : 
      - available in only 1 AZ
      - can create snapshot and store in another AZ


Aurora:
-------

. It is a Relational database and My-SQL compatiable

. very cheap when compared to open sources like oracle

. Better performance

. Scaling :
    - Storage : Auto scales in 10GB increments
    - Compute : Manual and will have a small downtime.

    - will have 6 copies of data stored ( 2 per each AZ)
    - can handle two data losses for writes and three data losses for read
    - Aurora storage is self healing. Contionusly performs scanning for errors

. Replicas :

    Aurora Replica : can have 15 replicas

    Read Replica : can have 5 Read replicas
 
    ***** If main database fails in Aurora then fail over will be set to replicas (That means high redundancy). Opposite in Read Replicas.


Notes:
------

Server        IOPS          Storage

SQL           1000-32,000   100GB-16TB
MYSQL         1000-40,000   100GB-16TB
PostgreSQL    1000-42,000   100GB-16TB
MariaDB       1000-42,000   100GB-16TB
Oracle        1000-42,000   100GB-16TB

Relational Databases are :  Oracle, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora and Redshift (it is datawarehouse but comes under relational concept)

Non-Relational Databases : DynamoDB, Elastic Cache and Neptune

AWS Neptune : Used for "Graph Databases" , highly connected datasets

AWS DMS (DataBase Migration Service) : helps with database migration

Redshift spectrum : feature of redshift we can run queries aganst exabytes of data stored in S3.
