CodeCommit:
-----------
. source control system in aws
. can store packages also (jar/zip etc)
. provides all functionalities in GIT. Can use git in local machine and interact with aws code commit.
. Data is encrypted both at transit and at rest.
. will integrate with SNS to send emails for commits, pull requests.
. ** For connecting git local to codecommit via 'https', we need to add awsconfigure with user secret ID and key.

CodeDeploy:
-----------

. CodeDeploy automates deployments to ec2, lambda and on-premisis.

. Roll back is possible in deployment.

. Code Deployment Methods:

   - In-place deployments: instances serving applications will be stopped, deployed with new code and then restarted.
                           we can use load balancer to de-regitser traffic register traffic after deployments.
                           Only ec2 and local instances can follow this process.

   - Blue/Green Deployments : a new set of instances are created and deployment is taken on these new instances.
                              After successful deployment on new instances, traffic is routed to new instances and old instances are terminated.
                              EC2 can follow this model.

       . Blue/Green Deployment Lambda: Lambda can only follow Blue/Green model.
                                       Traffic is shifted from one version of function to another.
                                       Traffic can be shifted from one lambda to another in multiple ways:
                			 - Canary: A percentage of traffic shifted to new version. If no issues then shift all traffic.
                			 - Linear: Traffic is shifted in equal increments in equal time limits. Like 10% of traffic to be shifted every 5 minutes.
                			 - All At Once: Shift all traffic to a function at once.


. AppSpec File :

   - It is used to define parameters which define if codedeploy takes place in ec2/on premises/lambda.
   - It can be YAML or JSON for Lambda.
      - Version: Reserved for future use
      - Resources: Name & Property of lambda function
      - Hooks: specifies lambda to run at set points in deployment lifecycle.

   - Appsec File Hooks - Lambda:
      . Before Allow Traffic: lambda functions to run before traffic is routed to newly deployed function.
      . After Allow Traffic: lambda functions to run after traffic is routed to newly deployed function.

   - Appsec File Hooks - ec2/on-premisis
       - version : For future use
       - OS : Operating system
       - files : location of appsec files
       - hooks : scripts to run at set points in deployment lifecycle.
       - The yaml file should be placed in top level directory.

        . BeforeBlockTraffic: Run tasks on instances before they are de-registered
        . BlockTraffic:  De-registers instances from ELB
        . AfterBlockTraffic: Run tasks on instances after they are de-registered

        . ApplicationStop : Stop application before deploying new version.
        . DownloadBundle: codedeploy agent copies bundle to temporary location
        . BeforeInstall: Details of pre-installation scripts.
        . Install: copy files from temporary location to correct location.
        . AfterInstall: Details of Post install
        . ApplicationStart: Restarts any services that were stopped during ApplicationStop
        . ValidateService: Details of any tests to validate service.


- Order of codehooks for codedeploy deployment process:

  START                               ApplicationStop               BeforeAllowTraffic
   |                                     |				|
  BeforeBlockTraffic                  DownloadBundle		    AllowTraffic
   |                                     |				|
  BlockTraffic                        BeforeInstall		    AfterAllowTraffic
   |                                     |				|
  AfterBlockTraffic		      Install			    END
					 |
 (De-register from ELB)		      AfterInstall                 (Re-register with ELB)
					 |
				      ApplicationStart
					 |
				      ValidateService


*** appspec file should be 'yml' for ec2. For lambda it can be 'yml' or 'json'.


CodePipeline:
-------------
. It is a CD pipeline feature provided by AWS to visualize, model software release process.
. It can orchestrate Build, Test and Deployment process.

CodeBuild:
----------
. compiles code, runs tests and produce deploy ready artifacts.
. We define build configuration in buildspec.yml (or) it can be provided inline
. Build logs can be found in codebuild logs or cloudwatch
. scales up and down - so no wait in queue

CodeStar:
---------
. cloud based development service which provides tools for code, build and deploy.
. Can integrate with Jira.
. Codestar provide project dashboard like Jira, where we can check status of multiple tasks.
