. Kinesis: stream huge amounts of data . data like IOT , social media and process them.

. Processing of data:
     - Redshift for Business Intelligence
     - Elastic Map Reduce for Big Data Processing. We can ssh to elastic map reduce


. SWF workers are : workflow starters, deciders and actual workers
  ---------------
. AWS Organizations: Manage multiple aws accounts across organization.It has two feature sets:
  ----------------- - consolidating billing : There will be a "Paying Account" and multiple aws accounts are linked to it. So we will have one single bill which shows details of bills in multiple accounts.
                                                - Pyaing account is only for bill payment, don't use it for regular activities.
                      - all features

  ***** Cloud Trail is per aws account and enabled per region. But we can aggregate logs by input all multi account logs to a S3 bucket in billing account
 . over all less costs
 . can apply polocies across all accounts. Organization policy is primary consideration.
 . Paying account sends request to Linked account.
 . ** Create IAM users in Master account. Enable cross account Roles and allow Policies to these Roles. - When master account users wants to access other accounts
 
. Cross Account Access: If a developer in developer aws account wants to access production aws account:
  --------------------
       : In production account : Create IAM Cross Account Access Roles and attach a policy to that role to switch between aws accounts
       : In developer account : create user/group and attach an "Inline Policy" to "Assume Role"

.Tags:
      - key value pairs
      - metadata

. Resource Groups: Groups different aws resources based on the tags attached to them.
  ---------------
. Direct Connect: Used to establish connection between our local network to AWS
  --------------     - for urgent needs use VPN
                     - Direct Connect needs huge time to setup connection as it is a hardware installation.

. Security Token Service (STS): Grants users temporary access & credentials to use aws resources:
  ----------------------------
     - Federation: users in organization can access aws using SAML
                   single sign on
     - Federation on Mobile: AWS Cognito for facebook, google etc where users can use facebook cred's to use aws
     - Cross Account Access: Temporary access is provided to switch accounts

     Key Terms:
       - Federation : Active Directory, SAML
       - Identity Broker: allows to take identity from point A and join it to point B
       - Identity Store: Active Directory, facebook, google etc
       - Identities: A user of a service like Facebook

    ** STS token can be valid between 1 to 36 hours

     **** STS sends 4 data:  access key id, secret access key , token and duration

   how we login using LDAP: 1) user access a portal 
                            2) portal sends request to Identity Broker
                            3) Identity Broker checks credentials with LDAP directory
                            4) Identity Broker contacts STS for temporary credentials and sends these cred's to portal
                            5) These temp cred's are used to login to aws.

Active Directory Login:
    . We use a portal to sign in
    . It first checks cred's with LDAP
    . If matches generates a STS

Workspaces: Workspaces are VDI. Replacement of desktops with cloud computers to do regular activities. (just like citrix receiver)
----------  workspaces are persistent
            all data in D drive is backed every 12 hrs
            don't need to login to aws to access workspaces

ECS Elastic Container Service: Manage, scale docker containers in AWS
-----------------------------  ECR : Elastic Container Registry where we can store docker images
 
   ECS Task: A task definition is required to run docker containers in ecs. It is json format.
             we define image name, cpu, ports, CMD, variables, volumes, users

   ECS Services: allows to run & maintain minimum number of ecs tasks defined in ecs cluster. If a task fails, ecs service will launch another instance of task.

   ECS Cluster: grouping of containers that can take tasks on. Clusters are region specific.

   ECS Scheduler: Service and custom . Schedule to run tasks/containers

   Fargate: AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS and EKS* that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.
   
   ** ECS supports ALB and ELB , so dynamic port mapping is allowed.
   
   ** ECS tasks uses IAM Roles to launch containers, this is used to differentiate each container serving an individual request.

Different Types of casting (Route 53 helpful):
----------------------------------------------
1) Unicast : 1 to 1
2) Broadcaast : 1 to many (if all nodes are in same subnet)
3) Multicast : 1/many to many -- can cross subnet, nodes has to register to multicast
4) Anycast: many to few -- same network in multiple spots and use shortest path


Elastic Map Reduce (EMR):
-------------------------
. analyze huge amounts of data like hadoop, big data
. we upload data to S3 and there is a ec2's cluster which will analyze data for us. 
. Analyzed data will be send to S3.
. * As it has ec2's involved, we can ssh to them
. We can configure multiple clusters to process data from S3.
. AWS manages security groups for EMR.
. EMR can provision dedicated, spot and reserved instances. We can also use different instance types (t,m,c ..) , based on requirements.
. * EMR launches all ec2 instances in one AZ for better performance.


AWS Config:
-----------
. Monitors and audits configuration changes made to aws resources

AWS OpsWorks: Orchestration service that uses chef
------------   - key words : chef, recipe, cook books

AWS Cloudwatch:  logs, data about aws resoucres. like elb health check.
--------------- 

AWS Cloudtrail: For auditing purposes. history of account activities and actions taken
--------------

AWS Trusted Advisor: Advices on best practices
-------------------  
                     - Checks : Cost Optimzation (under utilized resources)
                     - Performance : Recomend on how to improve speed/reponsiveness
                     - Security : Any security breaches/gaps
                     - Fault Tolerance : Over utilized resources, service limits

AWS Elastic BeanStalk: we upload code and amazon take care of ec2's, elb, auto scale etc etc.
---------------------  Applications have environments, environments have deployments
                       can integrate with S3 (elasticbeanstalk-region-account-id), cloudtrial and RDS. 

AWS WAF: AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
-------  - firewall to cloudfront
         - allow all requests except specified, deny all requests except specified, count the requests that match reference

AWS Step Functions:
------------------
       - logical flow of functions
       - we define which function to start first and how to trigger remaning functions (either decision/parallel/step) and step function does execute in order we define and provide a graphical UI of flow.
       - step functions are serverless.
       
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS):
----------------------------------
       - migrate local servers to AWS.
       - migrated servers volume will be stored as AMI, which can be used to launch ec2 instances.
       - better option than VM import

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):
------------------------------------
      - migrate local databases to cloud 
      - can be also useful for continous replication of data from local to cloud or cloud to local
      
AWS Support Tiers:
------------------
.Basic
.Developer
.Business : 1hr response time
.Enterprise: 15mn response time

AWS Cloudformation:
-------------------
. json/yaml format templates
. create and manage aws resources on fly
. * Stack is a collection of AWS resources as a single unit in a template
. Provides 'Wait Condition'

AWS CLoudtrial:
---------------
. Get user information who accessed aws vipa console/api/sdk
. auditing purpose
. stores data in S3
. Can be enabled per region or for all regions
. When using cloudtrial for IAM, cloudfront (global resources) , all region cloudtrial should be enabled.

AWS Cloudwatch:
---------------
. Monitors AWS resources and tracks metrics
. Can set alarms based on specifications:
    - alarms can send sns notifications
    - alarms can start/stop/terminate ec2 instances, autoscaling
    - alarms will have :
                        1) OK - metric is within threshold
                        2) ALARM - metric is outside of threshold
                        3) INSUFFICIENT_DATA - metric just started, no enough data
. Metrics can be built-in or custom created
. Cloudwatch logs - detailed monitoring. we install a small software in ec2 instances and that package will send detailed logs to cloudwatch.
. Cloudwatch events - event triggered. When certain conditions match or events happen, then trigger a lambda function
. Cloudwatch is region specific

AWS Cognito:
-----------
. Cognito provides features on mobile applications, where users sign in information to google/facebook etc will be used to connect to AWS resources.
. User Pools : Users sign in to facebook/google etc and send this sign in info to Cognito.
. Identity Pools : Cognito uses this User Pools info and generate a temporary token using Identity Pools to connect to AWS.
. Cognito uses SNS for 'Push Synchronization'. This will be used in multiple sign in takes places to same account from different devices.
